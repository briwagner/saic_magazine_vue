  "intro": "<p>Elissa Tenny is the 15th executive and first woman to lead SAIC in its more than 150-year history. She is a career-long champion of art and design education and the liberal arts as well as an advocate of interdisciplinary practice, diversity in higher learning, and the role higher education plays in society and the world at large.</p>",
  "text": "<p><strong>What have the artists and designers at SAIC taught you?</strong></p><p>You learn more when exploring and iterating a problem (or painting or paper) than in rushing toward a solution.</p><p><strong>Something only artists can do?</strong></p><p>Artists are not separate from society. Rather, the artist is a citizen with the same obligation as every other citizen: to use their expertise to participate in the world. What is unique about the role of the artist and designer is that their expertise has to do with vision, meaning both what we look at aesthetically and the meaning that artists reveal. The visionary creativity of artists—to be able to see something before it is there— is essential to how humanity solves its problems.</p><p><strong>SAIC’s most significant contribution to Chicago?</strong></p><p>Our students and alums. They live here, many long after graduation, making and exhibiting art, adding to our experience—both in contemplation and in play— of this great city. Our students and alums keep Chicago a dynamic, engaged center for art and design.</p>",

The thinking is robust and broad. It’s energizing, and it feeds my imagination even through in-passing interactions.</p>",
